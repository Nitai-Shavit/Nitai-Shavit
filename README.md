### Hi, I'm Nitai Shavit
I'm a Physics & Mathematics graduate from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (B.Sc. 2025) and currently pursuing an M.Sc. in Physics at Ludwig-Maximilians-UniversitÃ¤t Munich (2025â€“2027, expected).

My interests lie at the intersection of **physics, mathematics, and programming** â€” particularly in **data analysis, simulation, and automation** for research and technology applications. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in **quantum computing**.

In my free time, I enjoy working on small projects â€” from **game prototypes** to **automation tools** for everyday tasks.

#### Technical Experience
- **Languages:** Python, C#, Java, MATLAB, JavaScript, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** Node.js, React, OpenCV, MongoDB, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Git  
- **Domains:** Data analysis, experimental automation, web applications

#### Recent Work
- Built Python tools for spectral analysis and quantum optics experiments  
- Developed full-stack web projects using Node.js and React  
- Created data-driven scripts for statistical and physical modeling
